  ### 1. Understand how and why computers use binary to represent all forms of data
-  Computers are made of millions of switches which means the system consists of 1s (ON) and 0s (OFF) only so any data needs to be converted to binary so that it can be processed by a computers.
- Data is converted using logic gates and stored in registers.
 ### 2. (a) Understand the denary, binary and hexadecimal number systems

| Number system | Base system    |     |
| ------------- | -------------- | --- |
| Binary        | Base 2 system  |     |
| Hexadecimal   | Base 16 system |     |
| Denary        | Base 10 system |     |
|               |                |     |
|               |                |     |
|               |                |     |
### 2. (b) (i) Convert between positive denary and positive binary

Example: convert 69 to binary numbers
64 + 4 + 1 = 69

| 128 | 64  | 32  | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   |     |     |
69 --> 01000101

Example: convert 00110011 to denary

| 128 | 64  | 32  | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   |
32 + 16 + 2 + 1 = 51
00110011 --> 51
