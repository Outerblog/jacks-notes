- Data is converted using logic gates and stored in registers.
 ### 2. **(a) Understand the denary, binary and hexadecimal number systems**

| Number system | Base system    |     |
| ------------- | -------------- | --- |
| Binary        | Base 2 system  |     |
| Hexadecimal   | Base 16 system |     |
| Denary        | Base 10 system |     |
|               |                |     |
|               |                |     |
|               |                |     |
